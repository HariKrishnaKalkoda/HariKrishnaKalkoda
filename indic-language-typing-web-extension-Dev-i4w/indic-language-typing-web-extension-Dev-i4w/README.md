#### Indic Language typing - Web extension

**Web Extension intro**


- There are many extensions in the internet which can do a translation.

-  We came up with a project that does a meaningful and relevant translation of few
indian languages rather than a word-to-word translation which many translators do.

- India is a country where there is an extensive collection of languages.


- With a enormous population of 135 cr many people would find difficult to 
understand english language and want to understand it in their local language.

- This is where our web extension comes in and we think that this will help many
people who want to understand the web in their regional language.
